# Technical Problems I faced
1. I am working on Drag and Drop project first time so I needed to work with documentations & online help.

2. I couldn't find the idea that how i can change the index depending drag and drop operation

3. I tried different methods & libararies for the drag and Drop animations but failed to solve

4. Then I decided to work with dnd kit.I thought it will work because I watched tutorial on it.

5. For design work I connected tailwindcss but then i noticed some classes  didn't worked properly then I took help from Stack OverFlow and fix the issue with postcss.config.js file

6. The biggest problem I faced in this project which took my most effort is
The main_img_container from SingleImage component wasn't working properly. My input checkbox wasn't firing on click. Then i breakdown the bug with consoling every step. I found that {...listeners} was the reason that my function not working. Then I bring the {...Listeners} from parent div to a seperate div and change my css then everything worked. 

# Optional Text
In this project I took a lot of help from Chatgpt , Youtube tutorials & Stack OverFlow.
